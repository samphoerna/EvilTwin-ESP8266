#### Evil Twin Framewok

An **Evil Twin attack** is a type of wireless network attack where a malicious actor sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. The attacker creates a fake Wi-Fi hotspot with the same or similar name (SSID) as a trusted network, luring unsuspecting users to connect to it, thinking it is a genuine and secure network.
